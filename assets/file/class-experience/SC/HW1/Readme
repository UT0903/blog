addAndMax.py:
    python sample code, get the input from online judge
    addAndMax(A, B):
        write your python code here
        A, B:
            two-dimension python lists
            datatype = int
            two-dimension lists size are between 1x1 and 20x20 
        return:
            max element value in new matrix, ex. 995.0
            must return number with one decimal place, ex. X.0

    main():
        load input matrix from comandline
        for loop:
            range(20) the parameter '20' means how many pair of AB matrices it reads
            you can change the number to 1 to read only one pair of AB matrices
           *>>>but you must change it to 20 when upload to judge system<<<

student.m:
    Matlab sample code, almost same as addAndMax.py

input format:
    3 2: row column for the first matrix A
    2 3 1 5 4 6: matrix elements in A
    2 4: row column for the second matrix B
    1 2 3 7 5 4 2 3: matrix elements in B

    into
    A = [[2, 3], [1, 5], [4, 6]]
    B = [[1, 2, 3, 7], [5, 4, 2, 3]]

    and should return 9.0

local test:
    you can type this code in terminal to test your code
    python addAndMax.py < input

It is recommended not to copy sample code to Judge system directly.
Please upload as a python file, or the space may cause error.
